# Mechanical Drawing Comparison

This project is aimed at comparing two mechanical drawings and determining the differences between them. The goal is to provide an automated way to detect any changes made to a drawing, which can be useful in various industries such as manufacturing, architecture and engineering.

Automated mechanical drawing comparison can be useful in various industries where changes are made to drawings regularly. This project provides a basic understanding of how this can be achieved using edge detection and image processing techniques. However, it should be noted that this approach has limitations and may not work in all scenarios. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the results and validate them against the original drawings.
